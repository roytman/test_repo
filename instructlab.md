# InstructLab taxonomy extension

To extend InstructLab taxonomy knowledge user should do the following steps:
- Clone a pre-created github repository into a temporary repository (will be used to store Markdown files).
- Convert given PDF files into Markdown (MD) format and store them in the directory of the cloned git repository.
- Push the Markdown files into the git repository.
- Use the last commit hash id to create a qna.yaml file according to the following url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/instructlab/taxonomy/refs/heads/main/docs/template_qna.yaml. This file would be used later.
