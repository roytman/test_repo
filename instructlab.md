# InstructLab Taxonomy Extension

To extend the InstructLab taxonomy knowledge, the user should follow these steps:
- Clone a pre-created GitHub repository into a temporary directory (this will be used to store Markdown files).
- Convert the provided PDF files into Markdown (MD) format and save them in the directory of the cloned Git repository.
- Push the Markdown files to the Git repository.
- Use the last commit hash ID to create a qna.yaml file based on the following URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/instructlab/taxonomy/refs/heads/main/docs/template_qna.yaml. This file will be used later.
